# CFIApp
 Android application to extract CFI curves in real time. My diploma thesis at Electrical and Computer Engineering, AUTh.
 
 ## Supported features
 - Connection with the Skale smart bluetooth weight scale for real time meal weight sampling, through the Skale SDK. (not implemented yet, simulated for the time being)
 - Real time extraction of the cumulative food intake curve of the meal, in Python with the use of Chaquopy. Involves various signal processing techniques.
 - Calculation of important food intake indicators after the end of the meal, like food intake deceleration, total food intake, average bite size, etc.

### Work in progress
